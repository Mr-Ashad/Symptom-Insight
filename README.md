⦁	React.js Framework: Symptom Insight's user interface is developed using React.js, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for users. The framework's flexibility and scalability enable dynamic interactions, facilitating efficient symptom input and result presentation.

⦁	Python Data Preprocessing: Python serves as the backbone for data preprocessing within Symptom Insight. Leveraging Python's extensive libraries and data manipulation capabilities, the system efficiently cleans and organizes user-provided symptom data for subsequent analysis.

⦁	SVM Algorithm: At the core of Symptom Insight's data modeling lies the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVMs excel in classification tasks, making them ideal for predicting potential diseases based on reported symptoms. By leveraging SVMs, Symptom Insight delivers accurate and reliable diagnoses to users in real-time
